Question 11 _am - 6 Marks

Sample Answer

#!/usr/bin/python
import sys
n = int(sys.argv[1])
i = 2
while i < n:
if n % i == 0:
print n, "is composite"
sys.exit(0)
i += 1
print n, "is prime"

Marking Scheme:

5/6 single subtle minor bug in Python

4.5/6 single obvious/major bug in Python

If n of features below are present, mark =  n - 2
so if 5 features present mark is 3/6

if/while syntax 
no $ on variable
import sys 
accessing sys.argv[1]
int conversion of sys.argv
correct print statements

Question 11 _am Text

This Perl code tests whether an integer is prime.  Translate it to Python.

The Perl is correct and will execute without errors or warnings.

A copy of this Perl should be present in your directory in a file named `isprime.pl`

You can assume your Python script is given one positive integer as an argument.

Your Python script is not  permitted to use any external programs.  You are not permitted
to use Perl or Shell.

{{{
$n = $ARGV[0];
$i = 2;
while ($i < $n) {
    if ($n % $i == 0) {
        print "$n is composite\n";
        exit 0;
    }
    $i++;
}
print "$n is prime\n";
}}}
