Question 10_am - 2 Marks

Write a shell pipeline that given student enrollment data in the above format
outputs the middle names of all students.  

Each sequence of middle names should be printed on a separate line and  printed only once, no matter
how many students have these middle names or how many courses they are enrolled in.

Only the middle names should be printed.

The middle names should be printed in sorted order.

For example, given the above input your
pipeline should output this:

{{{
Augustus
Fredrick
June Anne
Nell
}}}

Your answer must be a shell pipeline. You may not use `while`, `for` or other loops.
You may not use Perl or Python.  You may use the usual Unix filters.

1.0/2.0  multiple middle names not handled at all
1.5/2.0  large number middle names not handled
1.5/2.0  minor error (passes 2 tests)

-0.5 penalty for extra blank lines on output

No penalty for assuming names only alphabetic
No penalty for assuming family name is a single word
