Question 13 _am Text

Write a CGI script in Shell which tests whether an integer is prime.

If your script is given no parameters, it should generate a 
suitable form to allow an integer to be submitted as
a parameter to the script.

You can assume `isprime.pl` is present in the same directory 
as your script, and use it to do the primality testing.

No error checking is necessary. You can assume that if your script is given a parameter, it is
given a single positive integer.

You can assume that your script is called using the GET method
and the web server provides an environment variable named
`QUERY_STRING` containing the query string.

Your script is not permitted to use any external programs other
than `isprime.pl`, `test`, `expr` and `sed`.  You are not permitted
to use python or perl.

You are permitted to use shell builtins including `echo` & `exit`.
