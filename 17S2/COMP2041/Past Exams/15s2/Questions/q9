Question 9_am - 2 Marks

Write a shell pipeline that given student enrollment data in the above format
outputs the student number of all students enrolled in exactly two courses.

The student numbers should be printed one per line and each student's  number
should be printed once.  The student numbers should be printed in sorted order.

For example, given the above input your
pipeline should output this:

{{{
3360582
3860448
3863711
5456732
}}}

Your answer must be a shell pipeline. You may not use `while`, `for` or other loops.
You may not use Perl or Python.  You may use the usual Unix filters.
