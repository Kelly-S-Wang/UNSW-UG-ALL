Question 14_am - 11 Marks

Write a program that reads lines of text from its standard input
and if a line contains two or more integers it swaps the first and second integer.

If a line contains less than two integers it should be printed unchanged.

If a line contains more than two integers only the first and second integer should be changed.

Lines may contain any number of any integers and they may contain any
number of any character between the integers.

You should treat all sequences of digits as positive integers. You do not need to consider
negative integers, floating point numbers, exponential or scientific notation.
