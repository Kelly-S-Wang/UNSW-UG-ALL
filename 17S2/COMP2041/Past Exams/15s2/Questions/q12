Question 12 _am - 6 Marks

Sample Answer

#!/bin/sh
n=$1
i=2
while test $i -lt $n
do
if test `expr $n % $i` = 0
then
echo "$n is composite"
exit 0
fi
i=`expr $i + 1`
done
echo "$n is prime"

Marking Scheme:

5/6 single subtle minor bug in Shell

4.5/6 single obvious/major bug in Shell

If n of features below are present, mark =  n - 2
so if 5 features present mark is 3/6

if/while syntax 
no $ on left hand side of assignments
accessing $1
arithmetic to increment $i
arithmetic for if.while conditions
echo statements

Question 12 _am Text

Translate the Perl in the previous question (isprime.pl) to Shell.

Your script is not  permitted to use any external programs other
than `test`, `expr` and `sed`.  You are not permitted
to use Python or Perl.

You are permitted to use shell builtins including `echo` & `exit`.

You can assume your Shell script is given a positive integer as argument.
