<h3>Aims</h3>
This exercise aims to give you practice in:
<ul>
<li> doing the kinds of questions that appear on the COMP2041 Prac Exam
</li><li> experiencing the pressures of solving problems without
prior preparation and within a time limit.
</li></ul>
Your goal is to complete several small programming exercises.
<p>
The assessable part of the lab will be conducted under exam-style conditions,
which means you can't communicate with other students
and the tutor can only clarify requirements,
fix any setup problems, and confirm the tests.
They will not help you solve the tasks.
</p><p>
You will use the same exam environment as the final exam and
submit your work within the exam environment during the lab.
</p><p>
Your tutor will determine your lab mark for this week based
on what you submit from the exam environment during the lab.
</p><p>
Your tutor will setup the exam environment, provide the exam questions
and explain more.

Write a shell pipeline that given input in this format
outputs the student numbers of
all female students.
</p><p>
The student numbers should be printed one per line and each student number should
be printed once.  Only the student numbers should be printed.
</p><p>
For example, given the above input your
pipeline should output this:
</p><p>
</p><pre>3860538

<h3>Part 3</h3>

Write a program which takes 0 or more arguments and prints some of
those arguments.
<p>
The first occurrence and only the first occurrence of any argument should be printed.
</p><p>
The argument should be printed on a single line.  A single space should separate
each argument.
</p><p>
Make your program behave <b>exactly</b> as indicated by the examples
below.
</p><p>
It must produce <b>exactly</b> the same output as below,
except you may print an extra space at the end of the line if you wish.
</p><p>
For example, if you program is named <code>a.out</code> here is how it should behave :
</p><p>
</p><pre>% a.out

Write a program that copies its standard input to standard output
but maps all numbers to their nearest whole number equivalent.
For example, <b>0.667</b> would be mapped to <b>1</b>,
<b>99.5</b> would be mapped to <b>100</b>, <b>16.35</b> would be
mapped to <b>16</b>, and so on.
All other text in the input should be transferred to the output
unchanged.
<p>
A <i>number</i> is defined as a string containing
some digit characters optionally  with a decimal point (<b>'.'</b>)
followed by one or more  digit characters.
You can assume numbers to do not have extra leading zeros.
</p><p>
For example <b>0</b>, <b>100</b>, <b>3.14159</b>, <b>1000.0</b>,
<b>0.999</b> and <b>12345.6789</b> are all valid numbers.
</p><p>
For example <b>007</b>, <b>1.2.3.4</b>, <b>3.</b>, are not valid numbers.
</p><p>
For example, given this input:
</p><p>
</p><pre>I spent $15.50 for 3.3kg of apples yesterday.
Pi is approximately 3.14159265358979
2000 is a leap year, 2001 is not.
</pre>
<p></p><p>
your program should produce this output:
</p><p>
</p><pre>I spent $16 for 3kg of apples yesterday.
Pi is approximately 3
2000 is a leap year, 2001 is not.

Write a program that reads lines of text from its standard input
and prints them to its standard output.
Except for lines which contain with a '#' character followed by a positive integer.
<p>
Lines of the form #n (where n is an
integer value), should be replaced this by the n'th line of input.
</p><p>
This transformation only applies to lines which start with a '#' character, followed by the digits of a positive integer
and then the newline character.  No other characters appear on such lines.
</p><p>
</p><p>
You may assume that:
lines are numbered starting from 1,
there are no more than 100 lines in the input,
no line is more than 80 characters long,
all n values are valid input line numbers,
and
no n values refer to other #n lines.

<h3>Part 3</h3>
<li>

Write a program that takes two command-line arguments, a string and a filename.
<p>
It should print all the lines in the file that contain the string.
</p><p>
When the lines are printed the occurrences of the string in the line should be surrounded by parentheses.
</p><p>
In other words, the program should behave like a very simple grep (no regexp) but add brackets.
</p><p>
You can assume the file exists and it is readable.
</p><p>
You can assume the string contains only alphanumeric characters, i.e. <code>[a-zA-Z0-9]</code>.
</p><p>
For example, if your program was named <code>a.out</code>, this is how it should behave:
</p><p>
</p><pre>% cat &gt;file
the
quick brown
fox jumps over the
lazy dog
% a.out file e
th(e)
fox jumps ov(e)r th(e)
% cat &gt;poem
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck
if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
% a.out poem wood
How much (wood) would a (wood)chuck chuck

We  have enrollment data where each line has this format:
<p>
</p><pre>    CourseCode|StudentID|FamilyName, GivenNames|Program|Gender
</pre>
<p></p><p>
We wish to convert the data to this format:
</p><p>
</p><pre>    CourseCode|StudentID|GivenNames FamilyName|Program|Gender
</pre>
<p></p><p>
Write a program which reads data in the first format from its
standard input and writes it in the second format to its standard output.
The following shows an example input/output pair for this program:

A university has a problem with students accumulating large library fines.
The vice-chancellor has decided to expel the student with the largest
total library fine.  We need a program which tallies the library fines
of students and prints the name of the student with the largest total
library fine.
<p>
The input to this program will be a series of pairs of student names
and library fines.
</p><p>
The output of this program  will be a single student name and a total
library fine.
</p><p>
At this university, students are identified by their given names, which are
unique and consist only of lower case alphabetic letters.
</p><p>
At this university, library fines are always a small positive integer
number of dollars.
</p><p>
Write a program which reads a series of pairs of student names
and library fines from its standard input.
</p><p>
When the end of input is reached your program should print the student
with the largest total library fine.
</p><p>
Your program should place no limit on the number of students and  no limit on the number of fines.
</p><p>
There will be a penalty if your program places any
fixed limit on the number of students or the number of fines.
</p><p>
Make your program behave <b>exactly</b> as indicated by the example
below.  For example:
</p><p>
</p><pre>Enter student name: fred
Enter library fine: 3
Enter student name: mary
Enter library fine: 7
Enter student name: fred
Enter library fine: 2
Enter student name: john
Enter library fine: 4
Enter student name: mary
Enter library fine: 1
Enter student name: fred
Enter library fine: 4
Enter student name: &lt;control-d&gt;
Expel fred whose library fines total $9
</pre>
<p></p><p>
Note, the <code>&lt;control-d&gt;</code> in the example above indicates the user typing this key to indicate
the end-of-input.  This will not actually appear on the screen.  What actually appears when the <code>&lt;control-d&gt;</code>
key is typed varies between machines.
</p><p>
Your program does <b>not</b> have to print <code>"&lt;control-d&gt;"</code>.
</p><p>
Your program can assume that student names consist only of
lower case alphabetic characters, i.e. no space or punctuation characters.
</p><p>
Your program can assume that student names are at most 32 characters long.
</p><p>
Your program can assume that fines are always small
postive integers.
</p><p>
Your program can assume that a student's total library fine will fit in an <i>int</i>.
</p><p>
Your program  should place no limit on the number of students.
</p><p>
Your program  should place no limit on the number of fines.
</p><p>
Your program can assume that there is always one student with
the largest total library fine (no ties).
In other words one student always has a total library fine larger than any other.
</p><p>
Your program can assume that there is at least one student with a library fine.
</p><p>
Your program can assume its input is correct.
</p><p>
No error checking is required.
